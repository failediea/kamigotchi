# Notion → CSV diff (`world:notion:diff`)

A **read-only** tool that compares the Notion design databases against the world-data CSVs in `deployment/world/data/`. It is the review gate for a Notion-driven data workflow: edit in Notion, diff here, review, then selectively apply + deploy index-scoped.

## Doctrine (why this is a diff, not an auto-sync)

Per the deploy runbook's "World data: three sources": **the chain is canon, Notion is design intent, the CSVs are the deploy vehicle.** Notion is a *drafting surface* — it carries work-in-progress, shelved ideas, and errors. So this tool **never writes a CSV and never deploys.** It surfaces the delta; a human decides what (if anything) ships.

A blind "sync Notion → CSV → deploy" would ship Shelved/Idea rows and clobber intentional CSV corrections. The July 2026 reconciliation proved drift runs both ways. Hence: diff, review, apply-scoped, deploy-index-scoped, verify-against-chain.

## Usage

```bash
# from packages/contracts
pnpm world:notion:diff:test          # all mapped tables
pnpm world:notion:diff:test --table items      # one table (substring match on label)
pnpm world:notion:diff:prod          # same, prod env file
```

Reads `NOTION_PAT` from `.env.<NODE_ENV>` (see Setup). Output per table:

- `key "X": unique on both sides ✓` — matching is trustworthy (or `! ABORT` if the key repeats).
- `+ only in Notion` / `~ changed` — each row shows `[status: X → <deploy implication>]`, per the world-data flag mechanics (runbook Procedure B): `To Deploy` → bulk-init candidate, `To Update`/`Revise Deployment` → bulk-revise candidate, `To Remove` → bulk-DELETE candidate (`To Delete` is flagged but inert — the script matches `To Remove`), `In Game` → live, `Ready`/`Test` → staged, everything else → **WIP / inert in bulk**. So you can see at a glance what applying + bulk-deploying a row would do (a `--args` deploy ignores status — you name what ships). Lookup-table rows show `ships with parent row` instead (they have no Status; they deploy with their parent quest/item/listing).
- `! only in CSV` — **reverse drift**: a row in the deploy vehicle that Notion lacks. Suspicious — verify before trusting (this is how a phantom listing gets caught).
- `~ changed` — per-cell value differences on matched rows.
- `not compared (complex types)` — relation/files/people columns are surfaced but not diffed.

## How it works

- **Name-matched, not hand-mapped.** CSV headers are 1:1 with Notion property names, so the engine maps columns to properties by name. Config (`mapping.ts`) only needs `{csv, db, key}`.
- **Self-validating key.** If the key column has duplicate values on either side, the table ABORTS rather than mis-match rows — a wrong key can never silently produce a bad diff. A `key` may also be an array of columns (composite key, joined into one match key) for tables with no single unique column.
- **`dupPolicy: 'first-wins'` for lookup tables.** Quest objectives/requirements/rewards, item requirements, and listing pricing/requirements are *lookup tables*: parent rows reference them BY NAME (`quests.csv Objectives` → `objectives.csv Description`, `listings.csv Buy Price` → `pricing.csv Key`), and the deploy pipeline resolves them with a first-wins map / `.find()`. `first-wins` mirrors that exactly: the diff keeps the first occurrence like a deploy would, and reports extras — identical dups are dead rows, **CONFLICTING dups mean deploy silently ships only the first version** (a red-flag finding). Blank-key lookup rows are flagged as unreachable-by-deploy. The parent→child *linkage* is still diffed on the parent table's list column; the lookup mapping diffs the row *content*.
- **`dbId` pin.** When a title is duplicated or near-duplicated in the workspace (stale copies and redesigns exist — the quest sub-tables have dead 2023 twins; "Body" exists twice; "Hands" is a redesign of "Hand"), the mapping pins the exact database id; the engine verifies the pinned db's live title still matches before diffing. Trait pins are provenance-proven: each CSV's Image paths embed the source db id.
- **`filter` slice.** One Notion db can fan out into several filtered CSVs (Droptables → items/npc/rooms copies by `Type`). The mapping's `filter: {prop, equals}` restricts the diff to that slice; out-of-scope rows are not drift. A filter matching 0 rows warns loudly (wrong prop/value).
- **Type-aware extraction.** Handles title, rich_text, number, select, status, multi_select, checkbox, url/email/phone, date, formula, and number/simple-array rollups. Relation-backed rollups stay "complex" (not diffed).
- **Tolerant compare.** Whitespace-collapsed, numeric-equal (`5` == `5.0`), order-insensitive multi-values, and boolean-canonical (CSV `Yes/No` == Notion checkbox `true/false`).

## Coverage (verified against live Notion 2026-07-23)

Diffed (28 tables): items, item-effects (allos), listings, quests, nodes, npc, factions, recipes, auctions, rooms, skills (Kami Skill Tree Tables), portal-tokens (Token Portal Registry), auth-roles (Role Addresses, composite key Name+Environment), trait-backgrounds/bodies/colors/faces/hands (dbId-pinned), quest-objectives, quest-requirements, quest-rewards, item-requirements, listing-requirements, listing-pricing, skill-effects (**"Kami Bonus Effects"** — the db titled "Skill Effects" is a stale 2024 table), droptables-items/npc/nodes (one db, `Type`-filtered).

Not mapped: `snapshot/` (chain-derived, no Notion source).

Position-correlated lists (droptable `Indices`/`Tiers`): array rollups are set-compared (Notion's display order is unstable), but the underlying order mirrors the relation order — so when a rollup matches as a set but not in sequence, the diff prints a `⇅ same set, different order` warning. A re-export after a relation re-order would ship a different pairing; check the paired column before applying.

Every run ends with a **recap**: one line per table (`=` in sync / `~` drift summary / `✗` failed). A skipped, aborted, or errored table fails the run (exit 1) — an incomplete diff never reads as a clean one.

## Extending

Add one line to `MAPPINGS` in `mapping.ts` (`{label, csv, db, key}`), re-run, and confirm the new row prints `key "…" unique ✓` before trusting its diff. If it ABORTs on a non-unique key: use a composite key (`key: ['A', 'B']`) when a column combination is unique, or `dupPolicy: 'first-wins'` ONLY when the deploy pipeline itself resolves that table first-wins (check the state script). If the title resolves to multiple databases, pin `dbId`.

## Setup

`NOTION_PAT` (the "Asphodel Studios" internal integration token) lives in the gitignored `.env.testing` / `.env.production` — same place the deploy commands read their secrets, never committed. The integration must be shared with each Notion database it reads (Share → add the integration). The loader strips a trailing `# comment` from the token value automatically.
